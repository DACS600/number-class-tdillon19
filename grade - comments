Assignment:  Number Class
Grade:  check+ (See Course Expectations for interpretation)


1 – For an infinite loop while(YES) would be a preferable form.

2 – Nice output and attention to details on the user interface.

3 – You show a solid understanding of all the essential concepts of this assignment.  You went beyond expectations in several cases, like computing things iteratively and recursively.

4 – For isPrime do not go all the way up to the number, at least stop halfway…maybe sooner.

5 – You have some timing stuff in there, but you have commented it all out, why?
